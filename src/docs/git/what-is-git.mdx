title: What is Git ?
---

First of all, [Github](https://github.com)is not git. Many people understandably confuse the two. GitHub is a website for hosting projects that use git.

**Git** is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. For example:

* When you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.
* Revert Files  or the whole project to an earlier state 
* Compare changes over time see who modified what? 
* Control modifications by collaborators with the permission of admin/owners
