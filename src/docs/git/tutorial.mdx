## Initial Setup

We will start with an extremely simple. we create a folder called `gitProject` on your desktop and put one file in it called `test.txt`. It will look like this:

```text
AAAA
BBBB
CCCC
```

Then to init the folder you need to enter this command in the terminal (this is Linux, so adjust for Windows if needed):

```shell
cd ~/Desktop/gitProject
git init
```

This marks the folder as a git "Repository." A Repository (or "repo") is just a folder that is tracked by Git and responds to Git commands. You'll know it's a repo because there will now be a .git sub-folder in there alongside your `test.txt` file.

## Adding to Staging
Enter this command in the terminal:

```shell
git add ./test.txt
```
This adds your file to staging. 

**Staging** is just a preparation area where you prepare all your files before you make an official `commit`. 

Think of a commit as permanently recording in your repo's history what changes you have made to your files. 

When you commit, whatever changes were staged will now be recorded in the history of your repository forever (there are ways to remove commits but its difficult and generally discouraged).

## Making a Commit
Enter this command in the terminal:

```shell
git commit -m "Created a file and this is my first commit!"
```

This command will commit the file with a message explaining the commit itself.

At this point you now have a local repository.
Keeping things local makes life a lot easier when learning the basics. That means you don't have to worry about `git push`, `git fetch`, or `git pull`.

## File Modification & A Second Commit
Next,let's make a change to our `test.txt`:

```text
DDDD
BBBB
CCCC
```

And then we commit those changes:

```shell
 git status
 ```

 This shows us the current status of our repo. 
 We can see very clearly that something has changed.

```shell
git add ./test.txt
git status
```

Ok, so now we can see that we have a file added to the staging area, but it's not committed yet. Let's change that!

```shell
git commit -m "Changed first line of the file"
git status
```

Now we can see that there are no changes left! 

Nothing to commit! Cool! ðŸŽ‰


## Git remote Command
The `git remote` command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. 

Let's try this command inside our folder  `gitProject`:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:myGithubName/myRepoName
```

What we are saying in our language to git is : 


```text
ðŸ‘‹ Hello Git on my local machine, Whenever I use the word origin, I am really talking about this repository on my Github account. Don't forget that! Thanks!ðŸ‘Œ
```
        
## Git Push Command

The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

Let's try this command inside our folder  `gitProject`:

```shell
git push origin master
```

What you are actually doing is saying :

```text
ðŸ‘‹  Hey Git! I want to save all of the commits of my current working branch to the master branch of 'origin'. You do remember what `origin` was, don't you?
```
*This is different from git push origin which will save all of the commits on ALL of your local branches to the matching branches on origin.*

Git response:

```text
Oh yes! I remember of course! You told me that 'origin' was such-and-such repository on your Github account! I will save your work (and your work history) there!
 ```
